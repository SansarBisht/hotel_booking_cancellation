# hotel_booking_cancellation
A chain of hotels, INN Hotels Group, is facing a problem of inventory loss due to booking cancellations, resulting in revenue loss. They want your help to build a Data Science solution that will help them predict the likelihood of a booking getting canceled so that they can take measures to fill in potential vacancies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a very important role in an end-to-end Data Science solution. It enables
  * Understanding the Data: EDA comprehensively reveals the dataset's structure, patterns, and issues. It assesses data quality, identifies missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, vital for preprocessing and model development.
  * Identifying Data Patterns and Insights: EDA discovers meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships through statistical techniques, visualizations, and summarization. It guides model development, hypothesis generation, and decision-making.
  * Feature Selection and Engineering: EDA identifies relevant features by analyzing variable relationships, exploring correlations, and visualizing distributions. It improves model prediction by selecting informative features and creating new ones through feature engineering.
- Data preprocessing is a crucial step as it enable the following:
  * Removing duplicate data: If your data contains duplicate records, it can skew your results. For example, if you are trying to calculate the average sales of a product, and your data includes duplicate sales records, the average will be artificially inflated.
  * Correcting errors: If your data contains errors, it can lead to inaccurate results. For example, if your data includes a product with a price of 1000, but the correct price is actually 100, your analysis will be inaccurate.
  * Filling in missing values: If your data contains missing values, it can make it difficult to analyze. For example, if you are trying to calculate the average age of a group of people, and your data includes missing ages, you will not be able to calculate an accurate average.
  * Transforming the data: Sometimes, it is necessary to transform the data into a different format in order to make it easier to analyze. For example, if your data is in the form of text, you may need to convert it into numbers in order to perform statistical analysis.
- Training a model is important because it allows machines to learn and perform tasks without explicit programming. It enables the following:
  * Learning from Data: models, such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms, learn patterns and make predictions based on data. Through training, the model can identify underlying patterns, correlations, and relationships in the data, enabling it to make accurate predictions or perform specific tasks.
  * Generalization and Adaptability: By training an ML model on diverse and representative data, it can learn generalizable patterns and rules that can be applied to new, unseen data. A well-trained model can adapt and make accurate predictions or decisions on new data points it hasn't encountered before.
  * Optimization and Performance Improvement: During the training process, ML models adjust their internal parameters and weights to minimize errors or maximize performance on the training data. Training allows models to fine-tune their internal mechanisms to achieve the best possible performance on the given task.
- Model tuning is important for:
  * Optimizing Performance: Model tuning allows for finding the optimal configuration of hyperparameters to maximize the performance of the ML model. By systematically adjusting the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, regularization strength, or tree depth, it is possible to find the combination that yields the best results, improving the model's accuracy, precision, recall, or other performance metrics.
  * Determining the right fit: Model tuning helps in finding the right set of model parameters that yield the best results. By tuning the model, it is possible to strike a balance and achieve an optimal level of complexity that ensures that the model neither fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data nor learns the training data too well but fails to generalize to new data.
  * Adapting to Data Characteristics: Model tuning allows for adapting the model to the specific characteristics of the data at hand. Different datasets may require different hyperparameter settings to achieve the best performance. By tuning the model, it becomes possible to adapt to data variations, handle different data distributions, or account for specific data properties, ultimately improving the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions.
- Model testing is important for:
  * Validating model performance: Testing helps assess how well the model performs under various conditions and scenarios.
  * Identifying and mitigating errors or flaws: Testing helps uncover any errors, bugs, or weaknesses in the model.
  * Assessing model robustness and generalizability: Testing helps evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data.
  * Building user trust and confidence: Model testing instills trust in the model's capabilities and predictions.
